The MPU6050 I2C Device Library provideS simple and intuitive interfaces to MPU6050 I2C device on ARM 32-bit STM32F103xx family of microcontrollers.It has the I2C bit- and byte-level communication for complete coverage of all functionality described by MPU6050 documentation.

The code is written primarily to support the MPU6050 I2C device implementation, but it may be useful to extend it to other I2C devices.

Documentation is created using Doxygen-style comments placed in each definition file, based on the information available in device's datasheet. This documentation will be available in HTML format on the http://harinadha.wordpress.com website, which also holds helpful information for some problems i faced in implementing this library.

This library depends on only the following header files from STM32F10xFWLib v3.3.0:

stm32f10x.h
stm32f10x_i2c.h

Want a library for a device that isn't up on the repository? Request it, or fork the code and contribute! Better yet, send me a device on a breakout board to test the code during development. No guarantees on how fast I can get it done, but I'd love to make good consistent and well-documented library for ARM STM32F103xx platform.
